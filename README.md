## The Major Leagues

This project accomplishes the following<br>
 
1. Set up a data science project structure in a new git repository in your GitHub account<br>
2. Download the product demand data set from<br>
https://www.kaggle.com/felixzhao/productdemandforecasting<br>
3. Load the data set into panda data frames<br>
4. Formulate one or two ideas on how feature engineering would help the data set to establish additional value using exploratory data analysis<br>
5. Build one or more forecasting models to determine the demand for a particular product using the other columns as features<br>
6. Document your process and results<br>
7. Commit your notebook, source code, visualizations and other supporting files to the git repository in GitHub<br>
